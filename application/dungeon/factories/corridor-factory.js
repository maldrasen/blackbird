  // We then pick a target cell. Pretty much the exact opposite of finding an origin cell. Just need to pick an empty
  // cell in the direction of the other feature.

  // solution with an L shaped corridor, maybe give up on connecting these features, add them to a black list and
  // find the next closest? That or we add a "three box" room.
