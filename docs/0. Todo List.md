Just as good as project management!

# Primary Tasks

### Training Systems
First primary task is to get the training system in a workable state. That's the primary focus of the game, so I want
to make that work before including anything else like day to day exploration, events, combat, anything that's not
directly related to training, stubbing things out as needed.

Currently working on the consent calculations. I don't think I'll need to fully implement all of this before I have something that at least works. Balancing the consent targets will be kind of impossible for now though, so I should at least add a few cheat actions to add and reduce arousal while all this is in development.

- Apply personality factors (like, loving, aggressive)
- Need to also read current scale values, as the current anima and animus values should effect consent.
- A few aspects (like erogenousThroat) might effect consent.
- Health and stamina? Being injured should reduce consent in general. What about stamina?
- Body part fit will also need to be taken into account. We'll need a general, will part fit into part class. Will it fit? Will it hurt? (Do you want it to hurt?) Will it be satisfying? Not big enough? Clearly a more complicated factor.
- Marks. The hate marks and lust marks should definitely effect consent.
- Calculate actual consent type. The type (enthusiastic, willing, reluctant, unwilling) will greatly effect how the sensations are produced.

### Dungeon Builder
Just to have something I can work on in public. I'm building rooms and simple one room features. Current goal here is to populate a dungeon level with features up to a target density. Add smaller corridors to make sure that everything is reachable. Then add doors to make sure that every part of the dungeon can be reached.

# Secondary Tasks

### Lactation
We set the breast's lactationFactor to 0 when we create a character. The `milky` trigger can then set lactation to a value between 90 and 100. We don't have any other systems that actually use this property though.

### Sanity System
Some training actions will damage a character's sanity. We should have a system that slowly increases sanity. Maybe by default this could be a single point a day, but a comfortable environment will raise that. Conversely, a particularly bad environment (enforced bondage rules) would drop sanity every day. If sanity drops to 0 overnight, we could enqueue a mindbreak event where the player finds the character in a broken state.

### Arousal Adjustments for Min and Max Orifice Width
High arousal levels should increase resting max width, maybe by 30% or so. This would need to read the arousal from the arousal component and the width from the orifice, to calculate the working max width. Arousal should also increase min width size, replicating an opening aroused pussy.

# Long Term Plans

### Tails and Horns
I'm going to build the body with tails and horns as simple string types at first. I think this will work in most cases. It's usually enough to simply state that a character has a dog tail for instance. Eventually I'll want to include things like tail cocks, which will need a more complex tail component that has a child cock component. The same could be said for some kind of unicorn horn type cock. Dicks everywhere! We can do this by setting the type to _component, then we would know that the details can be found in a Tail or Horn component. Not just dicks, but something like horn length or color might be important.

### Body piercings
The various body components either have associated components or have the body piercing data on the component itself. It kind of makes sense to just have piercing information as properties of the component. The breast component could have a simple piercingType property. However, depending on how deep I want to go here, a piercing component could be a child of another component. The breasts could have several piercings at once, nipple bars and areola rings at the same time. Each piercing could have a material. They could even carry enchantments so they would also count as equipment. And if that's the case then we'd need to see about equipping and unequipping various body piercings as a type of jewelry. Definitely more of a long term goal.

### Sexual History
One thing that's often tracked in Era games is who a character lost their various virginities to, first kisses, first anal fisting, all that. That's never really interested me, but something that some players might care about. It's easy enough to keep track of virginity status for already virgin characters. For players who start with some experience though there's no way to really construct a whole sexual history that's connected to other characters. I could just specify that it's someone you don't personally know. That might be the cleanest implementation. I should differentiate between someone you don't know and someone who the character themselves don't know, which has a different implication. I could also spell out their relationship. Was it their boyfriend, their boss, their father?

### All the way though
We've added a throat depth for the deepthroating activities, and can detect when stomach penetration happens. We could also add a gut length for an "all the way through" action. Perhaps there's an intestinal straightening magic that exists to make that possible? We should also add the case when a character has a massive volume of cum, and they cum during anal sex or deepthroating, then we should trigger cum vomiting or an anal cum explosion.

### Future Sex Actions / Features / Body Part Types
- Fuckable Nipples / Nipple cunts / Breast wombs and pregnancy
- Dick Nipples
- Penis tongue
- Tongue/s growing inside of anus.
- Fuckable Navel
- Ear Canal Penetration
- Ovipositors
- Tentacle Magic
- Internal Tentacles
- Vomit play
