Just as good as project management!

# Bugs
### Hair Color for Kobolds
We can randomly assign a kobold (named Scarlet) red hair. Perhaps the hair color mutation should change scale color when the species has scales, but no hair. Some furries, like equins and lupins have both hair and fur though. Some might not though, like the selkies. So we should add a hasHair property to species.

# Current Task

### Character Detail View
I think before going deeper into the training system, I need to build a detailed character view. I think the character details will always be a large casement. You can view a single character, but you can view them in training mode, at a location, in the dungeon, etc. Viewing a character in different locations will have different interaction options. In the training view, you probably can't have any interaction outside of the sex actions, so there's it's an information only view. When in a location though clicking on a character should list all the interaction options that you have with them (to include a 'start training' command)

### Update Character Builder
We're currently building the scales component with no initial anima or animus set. I think we need at least a few already present at character creation, initial part sensitivities and such. Likewise, I think we should pick a few sexual preferences to add to a character randomly as well. Perhaps both of these could come from the species, rather than being completely random.

# Primary Tasks

### Training Systems
I now need to get the training system in a workable state. That's the primary focus of the game, so I want to make that work before including anything else like day to day exploration, events, combat, anything that's not directly related to training, stubbing things out as needed. I've got the consent calculations in a decent state. Working on the training view interface now. 
##### Next Steps
- Disable actions that might become possible, but are currently unavailable. This would be actions that require a certain arousal threshold (i.e. cock must be erect) though there might be other requirements as well. Can't do this until we implement all the insertion size math.
- When an action is clicked, be build a command, send it to the state machine to be picked up by the training system, which then does the sensation calculations.

### Sexual Skills
The sensation calculations will need to take the player skill into account. These are probably skills like any other, with a primary and possible secondary attribute. The skill check is rolled as part of the sex action, the same way it would be for an 'attack'  or something. A skill roll can crit or fumble. A player gains skills by doing the action. In a training context I think failing the skill check still produces some sensations, though the positive sensations are reduced and the negative sensations are increased. A fumble should only produce increased negative sensations.

### Rework Personality
I don't think the current personality plan is going to work at all actually. It's good in theory, but the purpose of a personality is to produce dialog messages, and make decisions. Getting from the big 5 model to that is overly convoluted. I think I'll simplify this by first considering species and gender. I think a lot of dialog could be simply resolved by seeing that 'this is a male kobold' and would act and speak in a certain way. Because we want some variety with species/gender combos, we can optionally add a personality archetype to the character, something like noble, thug, bimbo, etc. These could just be a code that references a data object, or another personality component where we can tweak the 'strength' of the archetype. The personality will need to be able answer questions like, how violent is this character? Hmm, but probably only in ways that aren't already covered by the animus scales, sexual preferences, and attributes. We know a character is a bimbo if they have big tits, a low intelligence, and high sexual preference values. In other words, a character's personality is already mostly determined within existing components, their species, and their gender. So the personality component will just need to add a few missing pieces, then we have a module that generates dialog and answers personality questions based on all of this character data we have.

Right now, I think I'll at least need:
- Violent / Passive
- Excitable / Calm

### Attitudes
When building a character's dialog it would be most useful to have some kind of general attitude value. The attitude should be based off of the feelings, current marks, control, and perhaps personality. Basically, doing the heavy lifting of figuring out where in that multidimensional space their current attitude lies, and flattening it into a single value we can switch off of. For example:
- Resistant (low control, no fear or respect)
- Curious (low affection, low or no respect, no fear)
- Cautious (no affection, low respect, moderate fear)
I think I may work on some of the events and dialog first, to see what kind of attitudes that it makes sense for a character to take.

### Orders
When interacting with a character we can give them simple orders. Orders will need to go though the same consent calculations to see if they agree to follow the order. And we'll also need to get the attitude to see what the character's response should be. 

Orders could be fairly simple, such as 'follow me' which would have the character follow you when you move locations, 'stop following' or 'stay here' to place them in the current location. If they're told to stay someplace, they might just immediately leave if their control is too low, or wait for like 15 minutes, or an hour, or they'll wait there until they starve to death if their control is up in the obsessive range.

Other orders will be more complex, and need more of a response from the character or start an event. Some would bring up a new UI, such as orders for changing a characters clothes or equipment. Changing clothes will be a whole thing... There needs to be a UI component like any role playing game, but each time a piece of clothing is changed there could be an event as the person is logically changing clothes in front of you, or could be asked to equip magical nipple clamps or something.

Characters can obey or refuse orders. Either way I should add a memory record for the order. That way I can also have a punish or reward option, that will look at the last order. If they've refused the last order I can punish them for it, and say why they're being either punished or rewarded. 

Orders are essentially like mini training opportunities. They use the same consent models and can adjust anima, preferences, feelings, etc. But really only for a single action. Ordering a character to give you a quick blowjob, should also obviously be a thing.

### Described Component
I'm going to need to add a component to hold all of the different descriptions. A character can have multiple descriptions, a description for each body part, a description for each item of clothing, an actor description, a body description, etc. Descriptions have a parent ID, an optional type (in case a single component needs something like a long and short form description), and the text. We'll save the text in the weaver template format, so it can be updated when needed.

### Equipment
I'll also need to start working on clothing and equipment and such, both for the training and the dungeon parts of the game. Everyone's completely naked at the moment.

### Dungeon Builder
Just to have something I can work on in public. I'm building rooms and simple one room features. Current goal here is to populate a dungeon level with features up to a target density. Add smaller corridors to make sure that everything is reachable. Then add doors to make sure that every part of the dungeon can be reached.

# Secondary Tasks

### Update Consent Calculations
The consent calculations are only about half finished, in a state where it's good enough to move onto other tasks in the training system. I'll need to go back and implement the rest of this.
- Apply personality factors, once they've been reworked.
- Need to also read current scale values, as the current anima and animus values should effect consent.
- A few aspects (like erogenousThroat) might effect consent.
- Health and stamina? Being injured should reduce consent in general. What about stamina?
- Body part fit will also need to be taken into account. We'll need a general, will part fit into part class. Will it fit? Will it hurt? (Do you want it to hurt?) Will it be satisfying? Not big enough? Clearly a more complicated factor.
- Marks. The hate marks and lust marks should definitely effect consent.

### Arousal Adjustments for Min and Max Orifice Width
High arousal levels should increase resting max width, maybe by 30% or so. This would need to read the arousal from the arousal component and the width from the orifice, to calculate the working max width. Arousal should also increase min width size, replicating an opening aroused pussy.

### More Species
We could use a more oral focused species, in the same way that lupins have sensitive urethras and halflings have sensitive cervixes. The naga come to mind, as swallowing seem pretty central to the whole snake thing, but dealing with a legless species has all kinds of complications. Maybe some leggy snakes are needed then. Good to have another scaly at the very least. 

### Character Portraits
Character portraits are important to have, but something that can wait for a while. We need to finally actually use Electron for something, sending an IPC command to open a file dialog and copy the selected file into the user data directory. If we're copying the portrait, we might as well have an application wide portrait library so that portraits can be reused. We should also include some default portraits in the application assets. When uploading a new portrait (or from the portrait library) we should be able to zoom and crop the selected portrait into the correct aspect ratio. This would be a simple set size and position within a correctly sized frame, rather than an actual crop or file resize. We could also allow portraits to be labeled, deleted, and such from the library as well.

### Dances
When adding the striptease action, I started to think about other related sex actions. Once a player is nude they could perform a sensual dance as an action. There could be other dances as well, degrading, or self abusive dances. These dances should need to be learned somehow, and perhaps there should be a dancing skill. And if I'm adding all these mechanics then dancing should be an combat skill as well. Dances to arouse the opponents, or attract their attacks, or enthrall them. Assistants should have a dance task that aids the arousal buildup. During training we probably want to make dances all follow on actions of a single sensual dance action, and the dance can change to another type of dance. The 'dancing in front of' position is very limiting, and most player actions would stop the partner from dancing. There might be a few I could see working, like a slap ass or tits while dancing, a whip while dancing action, maybe a jack off while watching action (that would be available for all performance actions now that I think about it.)

### Drugs
Drugs or alcohol can be used as mood enhancers. Drugging a person against their will would of course produce anger, but you could be sneaky about it, if we had some kind of slight of hand skill. A strong enough drug and they won't even remember. A drugged character doesn't receive as much anima or animus, the amount reduced should depend on drug strength.

We're going to have a variety of drugs with different methods for giving them to the partner. They could be drunk, injected, inserted like a suppository, maybe even smoked or snorted. The way a drug is taken effects the consent values for the action, and also the effect in some cases. A sensitivity drug might be localized to only work on the part where it is inserted or injected.

This drug action though is very complex. I think I need to have a single 'use drug' action that starts an event. In the event you select which drug from your inventory, and where and how you want to administer it. The final choice in this event should use the same consent results, which would mean that the consent result model needs to also calculate consent for arbritrary event actions as well. That shouldn't be too involved, just using the same consent factors and target value.

Drugged should be a priority status effect that appears early in the sex action text tree, as the drugged version of a personality might be wholly different from their normal personality. Although some drugs, that only effect sensitivity, won't change personality at all.

### Lactation
We set the breast's lactationFactor to 0 when we create a character. The `milky` trigger can then set lactation to a value between 90 and 100. We don't have any other systems that actually use this property though.

### Sex Fluids
We should keep track of the fluids (cum, piss, milk, vomit) produced by each actor during training, keeping track of how much fluid goes into each orifice separately. It should be possible for a character to be impregnated during a training scene. It's possible that if the player and an assistant both came in the partner's womb we won't know who got that character pregnant. Need systems for all fluid volumes, how much a character cums, how much urine is in their bladder, etc. Cum base volume should be determined mostly by species, though testicle size has a small impact. (I know it doesn't make sense biologically) 

### Sanity System
Some training actions will damage a character's sanity. We should have a system that slowly increases sanity. Maybe by default this could be a single point a day, but a comfortable environment will raise that. Conversely, a particularly bad environment (enforced bondage rules) would drop sanity every day. If sanity drops to 0 overnight, we could enqueue a mindbreak event where the player finds the character in a broken state.

### Mood
Do we need a 'mood' variable as well. Mood could be set when the training is started. Could be based on a lot of different factors, but having the mood reflect the current emotional state of the partner character would start the training off at an advantage or disadvantage. Mood would be more variable than the other emotion scales. Could also be enhanced by some sex actions, and changed by the training sensations. Sounds like mood could be an entirely new scale, though it would also persist outside of training. Hmm, just something to consider.

# Long Term Plans

### Tails and Horns
I'm going to build the body with tails and horns as simple string types at first. I think this will work in most cases. It's usually enough to simply state that a character has a dog tail for instance. Eventually I'll want to include things like tail cocks, which will need a more complex tail component that has a child cock component. The same could be said for some kind of unicorn horn type cock. Dicks everywhere! We can do this by setting the type to `_component`, then we would know that the details can be found in a Tail or Horn component. Not just dicks, but something like horn length or color might be important.

### Body piercings
The various body components either have associated components or have the body piercing data on the component itself. It kind of makes sense to just have piercing information as properties of the component. The breast component could have a simple piercingType property. However, depending on how deep I want to go here, a piercing component could be a child of another component. The breasts could have several piercings at once, nipple bars and areola rings at the same time. Each piercing could have a material. They could even carry enchantments so they would also count as equipment. And if that's the case then we'd need to see about equipping and unequipping various body piercings as a type of jewelry. Definitely more of a long term goal.

### Sexual History
One thing that's often tracked in Era games is who a character lost their various virginities to, first kisses, first anal fisting, all that. That's never really interested me, but something that some players might care about. It's easy enough to keep track of virginity status for already virgin characters. For players who start with some experience though there's no way to really construct a whole sexual history that's connected to other characters. I could just specify that it's someone you don't personally know. That might be the cleanest implementation. I should differentiate between someone you don't know and someone who the character themselves don't know, which has a different implication. I could also spell out their relationship. Was it their boyfriend, their boss, their father?

### All the way though
We've added a throat depth for the deepthroating activities, and can detect when stomach penetration happens. We could also add a gut length for an "all the way through" action. Perhaps there's an intestinal straightening magic that exists to make that possible? We should also add the case when a character has a massive volume of cum, and they cum during anal sex or deepthroating, then we should trigger cum vomiting or an anal cum explosion.
