Blackbird has three different types of 'objects'
- Components - Simple plain objects that are persisted with an entity.
- Records - Immutable data objects.
- Models - Mutable objects with internal state.

### Records
Records are generally accessed by their code, a string label used to access the data with the record's `lookup()` function. The `lookup()` function returns a wrapped record object with accessor functions. When a system or another object needs a reference to a record, only the record code is stored.

### Models
I've never really liked the way Javascript does OOP, so Models in Blackbird follow the same self evaluating function expression pattern that everything else uses. This gives the application a functional programming 'flavor' without being real functional programming. These aren't true OOP models; there's no inheritance, no references to self. If I need something like inheritance I'll use a 'mixin' instead. (A function used to add functions to an object)

Models generally have a `build()` function used as a constructor. The constructor returns an object with internal state and functions to manipulate that state.
