Like the Weaver and Looms we need a way to easily define requirement objects. The CentralScrutinizer works like the Weaver, taking in the current context, and an array of requirements, checking to make sure that all the requirements pass. (We could also add an or mode as well, to check if any requirement passes, though we haven't needed that yet.) Like the Weaver, the Scrutinizers have a simple internal DSL.

#### Cock Scrutinizer
- `A:has-cock` Character A has a cock component.
#### Breast Scrutinizer
- `A:has-breasts` Character A has a breasts component.
#### Pussy Scrutinizer
- `A:has-pussy` Character A has a pussy component.
