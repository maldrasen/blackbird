I'm going to make a distinction between systems and modules in the application. Systems are specifically part of the state machine. They are run every turn, they receive commands, they process data and adjust components accordingly. 

Modules are just stateless encapsulations of functions that are not necessarily tied to a system. These are the helper or utility classes, on the simple end; or they can be more involved, needing to call other functions in other modules when called.
