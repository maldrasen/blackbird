Character's can also have tags that indicate that there's something unusual about them that doesn't fit into part of their personality or their sexual preferences. Or even if it is something that is accounted for by other systems we still might want to bring attention to it on the character status screen. Some aspects, like `noble` or `slave` work as simple tags, and are only a true/false sort of aspect. Other aspects can have rank, I think usually from the letter ranks (F,D,C,B,A) and maybe (S,SS,SSS) in some rare cases like `Productive`.

### Erogenous Zones
The Erogenous zones (cervix, throat, urethra) are a specific class of aspects. A character will not build sexual pleasure from these parts unless they have these aspects. These aspects can be granted by special events or with spells.
