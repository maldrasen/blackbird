### Affection / Fear / Respect 
These properties reflect how the character feels towards the player and other characters. The directed feelings will tie into the control system and in the consent calculations. Many of the other game systems will use these values as well.

### Range
The feelings are all neutral at 0. Affection and respect can go into the negative values, but fear cannot. (I don't think negative fear really makes sense.) The feelings are measured on a range from -1000 to 1000, though the higher a value is the more difficult it is to change. It should be almost impossible for feelings to reach 1000 in either direction.
- `0-200     `  Mild
- `200-400   `  Moderate
- `400-600   `  High
- `600-800   `  Very High
- `800-1000  `  Unusually Extreme *(insane)*
