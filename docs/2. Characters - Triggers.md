# Character Factory Triggers
These triggers are used by the `CharacterFactory` to randomly add make adjustments to the body, sexual preferences and 
other components. They are either passed into the factory to make a character that matches the trigger, added by the 
randomly selected name, or randomly added by the body factory.
