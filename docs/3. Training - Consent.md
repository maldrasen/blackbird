The first step needed for the sex actions is calculating all of the consent values for all of the available commands. We need to do this for all the available commands because we color the command text according to the consent level. That way the player will have an idea of how an action will be received before they choose it. (That's all the detail they'll get though as actions are performed when the action button is clicked.)

### Levels
Consent has four levels. These levels greatly effect how the action is received by the partner.
- **Eager** `(80-100)` - All of the positive sensation from this action get a bonus.
- **Accepting** `(20-80)` - Default value, sensation calculations are normal.
- **Reluctant** `(0-20)` - When consent is reluctant the positive sensation values are all penalized
- **Rape** `(<0)` - Increased negative sensations, anger, fear, etc. And very penalized positive values.

### Calculating Consent
Each action needs to have an array of consent factors. This should be an array because the order the calculations are performed in is important. Consent factors will need to come in a few different styles. We'll need additive factors to set the initial values. These should come from the feelings like affection, as well as their overall preferences for that type of action. We'll then multiply this initial value by the other factors. The factors can use simple linear scaling `(1 + preference/100)` or more complex geometric or exponential scaling.
