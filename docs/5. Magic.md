### Spell Levels
The level of the spell represents how difficult a spell is to learn. Each sphere has an associated skill. 
- (red) Sorcery
- (yellow) Thaumaturgy
- (green) Witchcraft
- (blue) Magic
- (black) Wizardry

A minimum number of points in each skill is needed to learn spells of higher levels.
- (0) - Level 1 (F Rank)
- (20) - Level 2 (D Rank)
- (40) - Level 3 (C Rank)
- (60) - Level 4 (B Rank)
- (80) - Level 5 (A Rank)

Casting spells successfully can increase skill. The chance of getting a skill point depends on the level of the spell cast when compared to the caster's skill. Casting level 1 spells when you have 10 skill points will have a good chance of giving you a skill point, but when you have 30 skill points it's a much lower chance. 
### Mana Pools
In addition to the separate skills, each type of mana draws from it's own mana pool. Mana is regained over time. We'll need some way to determine the mana regeneration rate of characters. We don't really have "levels" in this game though. I think most character power increases will have to come from exploring the dungeon. You learn spells by finding them in the dungeon. You get more mana by finding various shrines. The shrines could grant you spells or mana just by finding them, or there could be a whole event where you need to sexually satisfy the shrine maiden in order to receive her blessing. Or satisfy the shrine dude, either yourself or by sending one of your girls to do the job. NTR dudes will love that. Although, if we go that route, maybe only the person who did the sex gets the upgrade.

# Red Mana (Sorcerers) (Energy Sphere)
#### Shocking Grasp (Level 1)
- Either a full combat spell or reduced in power for mild electrical shocking.
#### Searing Palm (Level 1)
- Either a full combat spell or reduced in power for mild electrical shocking.
#### Fireball! (Level 3)
- Always spelled with an exclamation point.

# Yellow Mana (Thaumaturge) (Matter Sphere)
Acid effects and some poisons should be yellow effects.
#### Create Preserving Jar (Level 1)
Enchants a vessel to keep anything inside of it fresh. Usually used to store a large volume of cum.
#### Shaping (Level 2)
Change the shape of objects. (Sometimes while they're inside of someone else) Also used for bondage or capturing, if you can shape stone you can create foot traps in the dungeon floor. A metal shaper can fuse pieces of a person's armor together, trapping them. The type of shaping should be randomly generated. I'm thinking at ;east stone, metal, and wood. Maybe others.

# Green Mana (Witches) (Life Sphere)
#### Refresh (Level 1)
- Restore Stamina
#### Heal (Level 2)
- Restore Health
#### Fecund! (Level 2)
- Temporarily, but massively increase a character's cum or milk production. Also makes womb havers extremely fertile. 
#### Increase Sensitivity (Level 2)
- Class of spells that temporarily increase the sensitivity of a body part. (Adjusting their animus scale) Randomly pick which one. Could also dull sensation of a body part, which could be useful to reduce pain from some actions. 
#### Temporary Flesh Shaping (Level 2)
- Class of spells that temporarily change the shape of a body part. When the spell is generated we select a body part, tits, nipples, clit, cock, etc. We pick if the spell grows or shrinks the part, should usually grow. We'll have to keep size increases as some kind of temporary effect, and save it as a percentage. Every minute that passes reduces the percentage by a point. So giving a part an additional 60% would shrink back down to normal after an hour.
#### Permanent Flesh Shaping (Level 4)
- Class of spells that permanently change the shape of a body part. Works just like Temporary Flesh Shaping where the effected part is randomly selected. This permanently changes the size of the effected part on the body part component. Need to determine actual upper bounds for body parts or else this can make cocks 30 feet long. (Or do we just plan for situations when a person's body has become so warped they're helpless and immobile?)
#### Create Life (Level 5)
- Another class of randomly generated spells. Used to create living sex toys. The kind of toy it creates will be randomly generated. Mostly living cock snakes that can be used as dildos, capable of both cumming and pissing. Could also make things like little toothy mouths that can be used as nipple clamps or an inflating spiky blowfish like creature. Lots of different possibilities. Sex toy components are going to be intense.

# Blue Mana (Mages) (Mental Sphere)
Blue mana spells effect a target's mind and their senses. Character's should have a chance to resist any mind control spell through a saving throw like system. There should be an aspect that grants a lot of mental magic resistance.
#### Blind (Level 1)

#### Charm (Level 1)
- Makes a person generally more agreeable. Helps with consent actions.
#### Forced Orgasm (Level 2)
- Attempts to make a character cum. Could be resisted but will still add a massive amount of pleasure.
#### Orgasm Denial (Level 2)
- Prevent target character from reaching orgasm, for edging.
#### Sensory Depravation (Level 2)
- Character loses all senses except for touch. They are blind, deaf, and feel like they're floating in a featureless silent void. They can still feel everything else being done to their body though.
#### Manipulate Anima (Level 3)
- Class of spells that can change an anima level. The direction and anima effected are randomly picked. But could reduce suffering or increase desire.
#### Puppet (Level 4)
- Take control of a character's body
#### Change Sexual Preference (Level 5)
- Another class of randomly generated spells that can be discovered. These spells all adjust a specific sexual preference, and will only ever increase or decrease them. An induce 'hatred of anal sex' spell might not be super useful though, so spells that decrease preferences should be rare.

# Black Mana (Wizards) (Space & Time)
Time and space magic

#### Slow (Level 2)
- Combat only I think. There is a longer delay between the targeted character's turns.
#### Haste (Level 2)
- Combat only, reduces time between a character's turns.
#### Summon Cum (Level 3)
- Create a portal to an infernal river of demon cum, and take as much as you want.
#### Internal Portal (Level 4)
- This spell is a family of randomly generated variations on the same basic idea. You create a portal inside of someone's body in order to fuck them in a strange place, or direction, or when they're not expecting it. The generation should pick a location (anus, throat, womb, etc.), and a direction (facing inward, facing outward). The spell creates a persistent glory hole portal that can be used to fuck that location at any time. Could just use the portal to fill their mouth with cock all day, or surprise them when they're working. Lots of possibilities.
#### Portal to the Infernal Realms! (Level 5)
- Create a portals that allows for the summoning of tentacles.
#### Time Stop (Level 5)
- As seen in Era World.
