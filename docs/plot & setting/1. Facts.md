I'm still working on most of the plot and setting details, but there are a few things that I'm certain, or at least pretty sure about. Mostly things that have been informed by the game mechanics that are planned or are already in place.

- The game is set in a single city that has been built around the dungeon. The dungeon is older than the city itself, and the city was built to support the explorers of the dungeon.
- Slavery is common enough that it's generally accepted that people explore the dungeon to capture slaves. It is at least not unusual for people in the city to own or travel with slaves.
- The society is completely human dominated, and all the other species are considered sub-human, and can be owned.
