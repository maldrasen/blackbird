  // TODO: The normal anus descriptions should probably only be used when the
  //       character has no anal equipment. Describing someone's huge gaping
  //       asshole makes no sense if it's stuffed with a giant anal plug. Does
  //       this mean though that equipping and unequipping an item changes the
  //       character descriptions? Should clothing obscure certain body part
  //       descriptions? Do we add some text about how the character is
  //       presenting their asshole for inspection?
